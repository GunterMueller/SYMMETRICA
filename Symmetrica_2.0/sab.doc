   4. Polynomial Representations of GLm(C):
   ---------------------------------------
   GENERAL HINT:

        For the routines below are just for constructing small examples
        and very time-and space-consuming, the user should take care
        that his calculations do not exceed the following limits:

        i)  Group size <= 1000.

        ii) Matrix size (m^n) <= 256.

        a)  Decomposition of the n-fold tensorproduct of the identical
                representation of Glm(C) onto itself.

NAME:	
	glmndg
SYNOPSIS:    
	INT glmndg(m,n,M,VAR); OP m,n,M; INT VAR;

DESCRIPTION: 
	If VAR is equal to 0L the orthogonal representation 
                         is used for the decomposition, otherwise, if VAR 
                         equals 1L, the natural representation is considered.

                         The result is the  VECTOR-Object M, consisting of  
                         components of type MATRIX, representing the several 
                         irreducible matrix representations of GLm(C) with 
                         part_1' <= m, where part is a partition of n.

COMMENT:
        b)  Calculation of only one polynomial representation <<part>>
                of GLm(C).

NAME:
	glpdg
SYNOPSIS:     
	INT glpdg(m,part,M); OP m,part,M;

DESCRIPTION:  
	part has to be an PARTITION object with not more
                          than m parts.
                          For this partition, the program calculates the
                          polynomial irreducible representation
                          <<part>> of GLm(C), which ist stored in the 
                          MATRIX-Object M.

   ------------------------------------------------
NAME:
	glm_homtest
SYNOPSIS:     
	INT glm_homtest(m,M); OP m,M;

DESCRIPTION:  
	The relation D(A)*D(B) = D(A*B) is verified 
                        with two random integer matrices. 
                        In case of M not being a representation, the 
                        procedure displays an error message to stdout.

/* Documentation  of routines, concerning the calculation of 
   symmetry adapted bases for general finite permutation groups 

   1. Calculating of a general symmetry adapted Basis:
   --------------------------------------------------

          SYNOPSIS:     sab_input(S,SMat,M);    OP S,SMat,M;
                        group_gen(S,SMat,D,Di); OP S,SMat,D,Di;
                        sab(Di,D,B,M,mpc);      OP Di,D,B,M,mpc;

          The procedure sab_input reads the necessary input from the 
          standard-input.

          The input-format is as follows:

                 --------------------------------------------------------------      
                 nr of generators of  G             |       orderS

                 length n, where G <= Sn)           |

                 nr. of irred. representations      |       anz_irr
                 (INTEGER )                         |

                 --------------------------------------------------------------      
          With this input, group_gen calulates the whole symmetry group G.
          The group elements are stored in D the first line of their 
          irreducible matrix representations are stored in Di in the 
          order of the invers elements. D has the same type as S and Di 
          is a threedimensional VECTOR structure.

          Finally sab can be called, which calculates the symmetry adapted
          basis in B and the decomposed Operator in M as a vector of
          matrices representing the blockdiagonal structure of M.
          Every block occures once, its multiplicity ist stored in the
          vector mpc.
