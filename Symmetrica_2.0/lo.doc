	There is no documentation on the internal structure of the 
	longinter arithmetic.

NAME:
        mult_longint
SYNOPSIS:
        INT mult_longint(OP a,b,c)
DESCRIPTION:
        this is a undocumented subroutine of INT mult(OP a,b,c)
        You better use this general routine.

NAME:
        add_longint
SYNOPSIS:
        INT add_longint(OP a,b,c)
DESCRIPTION:
        this is a undocumented subroutine of INT add(OP a,b,c)
        You better use this general routine.

NAME:
        invers_longint
SYNOPSIS:
        INT invers_longint(OP a,b)
DESCRIPTION:
        this is a undocumented subroutine of INT invers(OP a,b)
        You better use this general routine.

NAME:
        copy_longint
SYNOPSIS:
        INT copy_longint(OP a,b)
DESCRIPTION:
        this is a undocumented subroutine of INT copy(OP a,b)
        You better use this general routine.

NAME:
        dec_longint
SYNOPSIS:
        INT dec_longint(OP a)
DESCRIPTION:
        this is a undocumented subroutine of INT dec(OP a). The
        INTEGER object a is decreased by 1.
        You better use the general routine dec.


NAME:
        tex_longint
SYNOPSIS:
        INT tex_longint(OP a)
DESCRIPTION:
        this is a undocumented subroutine of INT tex(OP a). The
        INTEGER object a is transformed into tex-source-code.
        You better use the general routine tex.

NAME:
        inc_longint
SYNOPSIS:
        INT inc_longint(OP a)
DESCRIPTION:
        this is a undocumented subroutine of INT inc(OP a). The
        INTEGER object a is increased by 1.
        You better use the general routine inc.


NAME:		
	random_longint
SYNOPSIS:	
	INT random_longint(OP a,b)
DESCRIPTION:	
	this computes a pseudo-random LONGINT number. 
	There are two possible calls, if b is a LONGINT number, it is 
	a new limit for  the random LONGINT objects, if it is NULL
	the old limit is used. The first limit is set during
	initialisation of SYMMETRICA.
	
COMMENT:
	There is a pair of routines for the  transformation from LONGINT to INT
	and vice versa. 

NAME:   
     	t_int_longint
SYNOPSIS:    
	INT t_int_longint(OP a,b)
DESCRIPTION: 
	transforms the INTEGER object a into 
	 LONGINT object b. a and b may be equal objects.
RETURN:      
	OK if no error

NAME:        
	t_longint_int
SYNOPSIS:    
	INT t_longint_int(OP a)
DESCRIPTION: 
	transforms the LONGINT object a into an INTEGER object,
	if it is possible, this means that the number which is
	represented by a, is small enough.
RETURN:      
	OK if no error
