NAME:		
	brauer_char
SYNOPSIS:	
	INT brauer_char(OP sn,OP prime,OP bc)
DESCRIPTION:
	computes the table (MATRIX object) of brauer characters for the
	symmetric group of degree sn (INTEGER object) and given prime
	(INTEGER object)

NAME:       
	decp_mat
SYNOPSIS:  
	INT decp_mat(OP n,OP p,OP dmat) 
DESCRIPTION: 
	computes the decomposition matrix to the symmetric 
	group Sn of degree n for the prime p.
         The result is the MATRIX object dmat.
	The routine first looks for the file decommix.dat in the
	actual directory. This file is generated during a previous 
	run of the routine decp_mat. So if the values are already
	stored in this file you get an imediate answer. Problems
	arise if the data in this file is corrupted because of 
	errors in previous runs. So to get the programm working
	correctly you have to remove this file decommix.dat

NAME:		
	dimension_mod
SYNOPSIS:	
	INT dimension_mod(OP part, OP prim, OP res)
DESCRIPTION:	
	computes the dimension of the modular irreducible
	representation labeled by the PARTITION object part,
	modulo the INTEGER object prim. 

NAME:		
	schnitt_mat
SYNOPSIS:	
	INT schnitt_mat(OP part, OP n, OP res)
DESCRIPTION:	
	this computes the matrix, whose modular rang gives the dimenion
	of the irreducible modular representation.

NAME:
	moddg
SYNOPSIS:
	INT moddg(prime,llambda,pi,dmat) OP prime; OP llambda; OP pi; OP dmat;
DESCRIPTION:
	computes a modular irreducible representation for the PERMUTATION object
	pi. The result is a MATRIX object with INTEGER entries. The representation is 
	labbeled by the PARTITION object llambda. The prime is the first parameter,
	a INTEGER object.
