COMMENT:
MONOM


MONOMobjects are special objects, which appear as entries of 
LISTobjects, in the case when we want to build POLYNOMs,
SCHURobjects or similiar things. It is a structure of two
components, one component is the coefficent and the second one
is an entry which labels one entry in the list, for example
to build a POLYNOMobject, we have  as self part of the list
a MONOMobject, whose self part is a VECTORobject of
INTEGERobjects, the koeff part is arbitrary. 

To access parts of the structure or two build a MONOMobject
there are the following standard routines and macros.

NAME:        
	b_sk_mo
SYNOPSIS:    
	INT b_sk_mo(OP a,b,c)
DESCRIPTION: 
	builds a MONOMobject out of the self part a and
       the koeff b. 'build' means that a and b become part
       of the resulting object, there is no copy.
       The result is the MONOMobject c. The return value is OK.

NAME:  
	      m_sk_mo
SYNOPSIS: 
	   INT m_sk_mo(OP a,b,c)
DESCRIPTION:
	 makes a MONOMobject out of the self part a and
       the koeff b. 'make' means that a and b are copied
       into the resulting object.
       The result is the MONOMobject c. The return value is OK.
