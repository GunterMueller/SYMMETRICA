	projective representations of th esymmetric group

NAME:       
	prsym 
SYNONPSIS:  
	INT prsym(OP lambda, OP T_v) 
DESCRIPTION: 
	computes the matrix representation of the involutions
	t_k which generate (together with -Id) the covering group T'_n
	(in Schur's notation) of S_n and stores them as MATRIX objects 
	in the VECTOR object T_v.
