this is a first version of SYMMETRICA V2.0 
you get all the source files (*.c) plus
header files (*.h) and some documentation (*.doc)

to build a first example simply use the
makefile which builds one executable
calculating the factorial.

the file used in the example (test.c) is
the only file not necessary for the library
to work. so if you want to do something
else substiute this file.
